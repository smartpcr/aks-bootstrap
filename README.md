# aks-bootstrap
Kubernetes is the top orchestration choice for developing microservices. Yet there are few examples to demonstrate how to setup .NET core apps on AKS that include the following setups:
- AAD
- ACR
- SSL
- DNS
- Key Vault
- Telemetry/Tracing

This project tries to automate essential pieces required for running microservices on AKS. After answering a few questions, the project will create infrastructure setup scripts and solution skeleton that allow user to deploy to cluster.
